# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project is part of **Task 01** of the SkillCraft Technology internship program. It implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on:

- Square footage (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of bathrooms (`TotalBathrooms`)

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## 📦 Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:
1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/uppadadhiraj/SCT_ML_1.git
```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```
pip install pandas sklearn
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the dataset (`train.csv`)
2. Select 3 key features affecting house prices
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate model using R² and Mean Squared Error
5. Take user input and predict house price
